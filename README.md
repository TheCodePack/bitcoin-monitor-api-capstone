## UX & User Stories: MVP

**Welcome Page** 

As a user, I want to understand what the app is and learn where the data is sourced so that I can determine the utility/validity of the app.

As a user, I need to be able to click a button to move forward from the landing page and utilize the app.

**Dashboard Page** 

As a user, I need to be able to select from several timeframes so that I can view current and historical data in the main chart.

As a user, I need each button representing timeframes to change the range of historical data displayed in the chart. 

As a user, I need to be able to pick the currency I want to view the price of Bitcoin in (USD or EURO) so that I can view current and historical data in the main chart.

As a user, I need each currency button to change the currency type displayed in the chart.

As a user, I want to have a newsfeed that shows the current top stories related to Bitcoin and be able to navigate to them so that I can view them on another page. 

As a user, I need a button that fetches and refreshes the data in the article newsfeed.
